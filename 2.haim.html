      Haim(meaning "life" in Hebrew,[a] stylized in all caps) is an American pop rock band, based in Los Angeles and comprising three sisters, Este (/ˈɛsti/ ESS-tee;[3] bass guitar and vocals), Danielle (lead vocals, guitar, and drums), and Alana Haim (/əˈlɑːnə/ ə-LAH-nə;[3] guitars, keyboards, and vocals). In addition to their primary instruments, each is proficient in several others. The group's pop sound on their studio work stands in contrast to the more rock-based music of their live shows.

    The sisters grew up in a musical family, and began playing instruments from an early age in the cover band Rockinhaim, fronted by their parents, Moti and Donna. The two elder sisters, Este and Danielle, performed briefly with the pop group Valli Girls in 2005, releasing a few songs on soundtrack and compilation albums under that name. In 2007, they formed Haim with younger sister Alana, but did not seriously consider it a professional career for some years. After Danielle became a successful touring guitarist, first with Jenny Lewis and later with Julian Casablancas, Haim reformed as a full-time operation in 2012.

    The group's first release, Forever (an EP released as a limited-time download), combined with positive reception at the South by Southwest festival, led to a deal with Polydor Records and a management deal with Jay-Z's Roc Nation group in mid-2012. The band began recording material for their first album, Days Are Gone, in sessions between touring dates, including appearances at the Glastonbury Festival. The album charted in the top ten in several countries, including the number-one spot in the UK, and the group had won several "best of" awards by the end of 2013. The group was nominated for Best New Artist at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. Their second album, Something to Tell You, was released in July 2017. Their third album, titled Women in Music Pt. III, was released in June 2020. The group received nominations at the 63rd Grammy awards for Album of the Year (for Women In Music Pt. III) and Best Rock Performance (for "The Steps").
